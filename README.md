## Tic-tac-toe
One of my first web applications. I hope you will enjoy. It's a simple tic tac toe game for 2 players. Have fun!

## Running
To run this project ```git clone``` it and run index.html file.

## What have I learned by doing this small project
1. Basics of Javascript.
2. Styling in css.
3. I have already known HTML, but it was a good reminder.
4. How to use SVG in future projects.
5. How to make website dynamic.
